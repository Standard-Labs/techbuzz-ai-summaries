```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the .env file to add your OpenAI API key
```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py

## Sample CSV Format

Your input CSV should have at least these two columns:

```
Description,URL
"Apple Pay, PayPal, Cash App will be treated more like banks","https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/21/apple-pay-paypal-cash-app-will-be-treated-more-like-banks/"

```

## Output Format

The app will add a 'Formatted' column with summaries in this format:

```
[Article Title](URL) â€” The **Organization** did **something important** that has **significant impact**.
```

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing the GPT-4o model

You can set these environment variables in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, or you can set them directly in your environment.

## Note

This application requires an OpenAI API key with access to the GPT-4o model. API usage will incur charges according to OpenAI's pricing.
